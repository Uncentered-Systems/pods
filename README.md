# Dial Podcasts
Podcast viewer and curator mobile application. Curation to be used with Dial.

## Develop
The app uses React Native (without Expo).
This repo provides a Nix + [Devenv](https://devenv.sh) developer environment (tested on Android only). If you have devenv installed you just need to enter the folder and run `npm start` to test the app in an emulator or connected phone.
